Your task is to transform the following user prompt into a more detailed and actionable version while preserving its original intent.

USER PROMPT:
{prompt}

Instructions:

Prompt Categorization:
Analyze the provided prompt and categorize it into one of the following core categories (select the most appropriate):
Creative Writing (e.g., novels, scripts, poetry)
Technical Documentation (e.g., manuals, API guides)
Marketing & Advertising (e.g., ads, social media posts)
Academic & Research (e.g., papers, theses)
User Interface/UX Design (e.g., wireframes, prototypes)
Digital Art & Graphic Design (e.g., NFTs, digital paintings)
Video Production (e.g., storyboards, editing guidelines)
Music Composition (e.g., scores, lyrics)
Customer Service (e.g., scripts, FAQs)
Business Strategy (e.g., plans, proposals)
Use the selected category to tailor language, technical terms, and contextual details.
Enhancement Objectives:
Clarity:
Replace ambiguous terms (e.g., "some," "a few") with exact quantities or percentages.
Break complex instructions into step-by-step actions.
Use active voice and imperative phrasing.
Specificity:
Include exact measurements, technical specifications, or brand names (e.g., "Adobe Photoshop 2023").
Define target demographics (e.g., "millennial urban professionals").
Specify platforms, tools, or formats (e.g., "4K resolution video for YouTube Shorts").
Context:
Add background on the project’s purpose, audience, or cultural setting.
Clarify industry standards (e.g., "GDPR compliance for EU users").
State the intended use case (e.g., "for a corporate annual report").
Constraints:
Define strict parameters (e.g., "200-word limit," "budget of $5,000").
Specify technical requirements (e.g., "compatible with iOS 16 and above").
Set boundaries for creativity (e.g., "avoid political references").
Usability:
Structure instructions with numbered steps or bullet points.
Use clear headings and subheadings.
Include examples or templates (e.g., "Sample email structure: [Subject], [Greeting], [Body]").
Comprehensiveness:
Address edge cases (e.g., "include fallback options for low-bandwidth users").
Cover all deliverables (e.g., "final files in .PNG and .SVG formats").
Anticipate user questions (e.g., "explain how to adjust for different screen sizes").
Preservation of Intent:
Cross-reference the enhanced prompt against the original to ensure alignment.
Maintain the core objective (e.g., "retain focus on promoting eco-friendly products").
Category-Specific Language:
For creative writing : Incorporate narrative structure, character arcs, and thematic elements.
For technical documentation : Use precise terminology and adhere to industry standards.
For digital art : Specify styles (e.g., "surrealism with neon gradients"), color palettes, and resolution.
For video production : Define frame rates, aspect ratios, and storytelling beats.
Response Format:
Provide only the enhanced prompt in the following structure:
Title: A concise, descriptive title (e.g., "Design a Minimalist Logo for a Sustainable Fashion Brand").
Instructions: Bullet points or numbered steps with clear, actionable directives.
Constraints: Bold or italicize limitations (e.g., "Deadline: 48 hours").
Examples: Include a sample output or visual reference (if applicable).
Exclude all commentary, explanations, or formatting beyond the prompt itself.
